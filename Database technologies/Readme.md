# DBMS
- Any enterprise application need to manage data.
- In early days of software development, programmers store data into files and does operation on it. However data is highly application specific.
- Even today many software manage their data in custom formats e.g. Tally, Address book, etc.
- As data management became more common, DBMS systems were developed to handle the data. This enabled developers to focus on the business logic e.g. FoxPro, DBase, Excel, etc.
- At least CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update and Delete) operations are supported by all databases.
- Traditional databases are file based, less secure, single-user, non- distributed, manage less amount of data (MB), complicated relation
management, file-locking and need number of lines of code to use in applications.

# RDBMS

- RDBMS is relational DBMS.
- It organizes data into Tables, rows and columns. The tables are related to each other.
- RDBMS follow table structure, more secure, multi-user, server-client architecture, server side processing, clustering support, manage huge data (TB), built-in relational capabilities, table-locking or row-locking and can be easily integrated with applications.
- e.g. DB2, Oracle, MS-SQL, MySQL, MS-Access, SQLite, … 
- RDBMS design is based on Codd’s rules developed at IBM (in 1970).

# SQL
- Clients send SQL queries to RDBMS server and operations are performed accordingly.
- Originally it was named as RQBE (Relational Query By Example).
- SQL is ANSI standardised in 1987 and then revised multiple times adding new features. Recent revision in 2016.
- SQL is case insensitive.
- There are five major categories:
- DDL: Data Definition Language e.g. CREATE, ALTER, DROP, RENAME.
- DML: Data Manipulation Language e.g. INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.
- DQL: Data Query Language e.g. SELECT.
- DCL: Data Control Language e.g. CREATE USER, GRANT, REVOKE.
- TCL: Transaction Control Language e.g. SAVEPOINT, COMMIT, ROLLBACK.
- Table & column names allows alphabets, digits & few special symbols.
- If name contains special symbols then it should be back-quotes.
- e.g. Tbl1, `T1#`, `T2$` etc. Names can be max 30 chars long.

# MySQL
- Developed by Michael Widenius in 1995. It is named after his daughter name Myia.
- Sun Microsystems acquired MySQL in 2008.
- Oracle acquired Sun Microsystem in 2010.
- MySQL is free and open-source database under GPL. However some enterprise modules are close sourced and available only under commercial version of MySQL.
- MariaDB is completely open-source clone of MySQL.
- MySQL support multiple database storage and processing engines.
- MySQL versions:
- < 5.5: MyISAM storage engine
- 5.5: InnoDb storage engine
- 5.6: SQL Query optimizer improved, memcached style NoSQL
- 5.7: Windowing functions, JSON data type added for flexible schema
- 8.0: CTE, NoSQL document store.
- MySQL is database of year 2019 (in database engine ranking).
# Getting started
- root login can be used to perform CRUD as well as admin operations.
- It is recommended to create users for performing non-admin tasks.
- mysql> CREATE DATABASE db;
- mysql> SHOW DATABASES;
- mysql> CREATE USER dbuser@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'dbpass';
- mysql> SELECT user, host FROM mysql.user;
- mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON db.* TO dbuser@localhost;
- mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
- mysql> EXIT;
- terminal> mysql –u dbuser –pdbpass
- mysql> SHOW DATABASES;
- mysql> SELECT USER(), DATABASE();
- mysql> USE db;
- mysql> SHOW TABLES;
- mysql> CREATE TABLE student(id INT, name VARCHAR(20), marks DOUBLE);
- mysql> INSERT INTO student VALUE
- mysql> SELECT * FROM student;

# Database logical layout
- Database/schema is like a namespace/container that stores all db objects related to a project.
- It contains tables, constraints, relations, stored procedures, functions, triggers, ...
- There are some system databases e.g. mysql, performance_schema, information_schema, sys, ... They contains db internal/system information.
- e.g. SELECT user, host FROM mysql.user;
- A database contains one or more tables.
- Tables have multiple columns.
- Each column is associated with a data-type.
- Columns may have zero or more constraints.
- The data in table is in multiple rows.
- Each row have multiple values (as per columns).

# Database physical layout
- In MySQL, the data is stored on disk in its data directory i.e. /var/lib/mysql
- Each database/schema is a separate sub-directory in data dir.
- Each table in the db, is a file on disk.
- e.g. student table in current db is stored in file /var/lib/mysql/db/student.ibd.
- Data is stored in binary format.
- A file may not be contiguously stored on hard disk.
- Data rows are not contiguous. They are scattered in the hard disk.
- In one row, all fields are consecutive.
- When records are selected, they are selected in any order.

# MySQL data types
- RDBMS have similar data types (but not same).
- MySQL data types can be categorised as follows
- Numeric types (Integers)
- TINYINT (1 byte), SMALLINT (2 byte), MEDIUMINT (3 byte), INT (4 byte), BIGINT (8 byte), BIT(n bits)
- integer types can signed (default) or unsigned.
- Numeric types (Floating point)
- approx. precision – FLOAT (4 byte), DOUBLE (8 byte) | DECIMAL(m, n) – exact precision
- Date/Time types
- DATE, TIME, DATETIME, TIMESTAMP, YEAR
- String types – size = number of chars * size of char
- CHAR(1-255) – Fixed length, Very fast access.
- VARCHAR(1-65535) – Variable length, Stores length + chars.
- TINYTEXT (255), TEXT (64K), MEDIUMTEXT (16M), LONGTEXT (4G) – Variable length, Slower access.
- Binary types – size = number of bytes
- BINARY, VARBINARY, TINYBLOB, BLOB, MEDIUMBLOB, LONGBLOB
- Miscellaneous types
- ENUM, SET

# CHAR vs VARCHAR vs TEXT
- CHAR
- Fixed inline storage.
- If smaller data is given, rest of space is unused.
- Very fast access.
- VARCHAR
- Variable inline storage.
- Stores length and characters.
- Slower access than CHAR.
- TEXT
- Variable external storage.
- Very slow access.
- Not ideal for indexing.
- CREATE TABLE temp(c1 CHAR(4), c2 VARCHAR(4), c3 TEXT(4));
- DESC temp;
- INSERT INTO temp VALUES('abcd', 'abcd', 'abcdef'); 

# INSERT – DML
- Insert a new row (all columns, fixed order).
- INSERT INTO table VALUES (v1, v2, v3);
- Insert a new row (specific columns, arbitrary order).
- INSERT INTO table(c3, c1, c2) VALUES (v3, v1, v2);
- INSERT INTO table(c1, c2) VALUES (v1, v2);
- Missing columns data is NULL.
- NULL is special value and it is not stored in database.
- Insert multiple rows.
- INSERT INTO table VALUES (av1, av2, av3), (bv1, bv2, bv3), (cv1, cv2, cv3).
- Insert rows from another table.
- INSERT INTO table SELECT c1, c2, c3 FROM another-table;
- INSERT INTO table (c1,c2) SELECT c1, c2 FROM another-table;

# SQL scripts
- SQL script is multiple SQL queries written into a .sql file.
- SQL scripts are mainly used while database backup and restore operations.
- SQL scripts can be executed from terminal as:
- terminal> mysql –u user –ppassword db < /path/to/sqlfile
- SQL scripts can be executed from command line as:
- mysql> SOURCE /path/to/sqlfile
- Note that SOURCE is MySQL CLI client command.
- It reads commands one by one from the script and execute them on server


# SELECT – DQL
- Select all columns (in fixed order).
- SELECT * FROM table;
- Select specific columns / in arbitrary order.
- SELECT c1, c2, c3 FROM table;
- Column alias
- SELECT c1 AS col1, c2 col2 FROM table;
- Computed columns.
- SELECT c1, c2, c3, expr1, expr2 FROM table;
	- SELECT c1,
	CASE WHEN condition1 THEN value1,
	WHEN condition2 THEN value2,
	…
	ELSE valuen
	END
	FROM table;	
- Distinct values in column.
	- SELECT DISTINCT c1 FROM table;
	- SELECT DISTINCT c1, c2 FROM table;
- Select limited rows.
	- SELECT * FROM table LIMIT n;
	- SELECT * FROM table LIMIT m, n;
	
# SELECT – DQL – ORDER BY
- In db rows are scattered on disk. Hence may not be fetched in a fixed order.
- Select rows in asc order.
	- SELECT * FROM table ORDER BY c1;
	- SELECT * FROM table ORDER BY c2 ASC;
- Select rows in desc order.
	- SELECT * FROM table ORDER BY c3 DESC;
- Select rows sorted on multiple columns.
	- SELECT * FROM table ORDER BY c1, c2;
	- SELECT * FROM table ORDER BY c1 ASC, c2 DESC;
	- SELECT * FROM table ORDER BY c1 DESC, c2 DESC;
- Select top or bottom n rows.
	- SELECT * FROM table ORDER BY c1 ASC LIMIT n;
	- SELECT * FROM table ORDER BY c1 DESC LIMIT n;
	- SELECT * FROM table ORDER BY c1 ASC LIMIT m, n;
	
# SELECT – DQL – WHERE

- It is always good idea to fetch only required rows (to reduce network traffic).
- The WHERE clause is used to specify the condition, which records to be fetched.
- Relational operators
	- <, >, <=, >=, =, != or <>
- NULL related operators
	- NULL is special value and cannot be compared using relational operators.
	- IS NULL or <=>, IS NOT NULL.
- Logical operators
	- AND, OR, NOT
- AND, OR, NOT

- BETWEEN operator (include both ends)
- c1 BETWEEN val1 AND val2
- IN operator (equality check with multiple values)
- c1 IN (val1, val2, val3)
- LIKE operator (similar strings)
- c1 LIKE ‘pattern’.
- % represent any number of any characters.
- _ represent any single character.


# UPDATE – DML
- To change one or more rows in a table.
- Update row(s) single column.
	- UPDATE table SET c2=new-value WHERE c1=some-value;
- Update multiple columns.
	- UPDATE table SET c2=new-value, c3=new-value WHERE c1=some-value;
- Update all rows single column.
	- UPDATE table SET c2=new-value;
	
# DELETE – DML vs TRUNCATE – DDL vs DROP – DDL
- DELETE	
- To delete one or more rows in a table.
- Delete row(s)
- DELETE FROM table WHERE c1=value;
- Delete all rows
	- DELETE FROM table
	
	
- TRUNCATE
- Delete all rows.
	- TRUNCATE TABLE table;
	- Truncate is faster than DELETE.
- DROP
	- Delete all rows as well as table structure.
		- DROP TABLE table;
		- DROP TABLE table IF EXISTS;
	- Delete database/schema.
		- DROP DATABASE db;
		
# Seeking HELP
- HELP is client command to seek help on commands/functions.
	- HELP SELECT;
	- HELP Functions;
	- HELP SIGN;
# DUAL table


- A dummy/in-memory a table having single row & single column.
- It is used for arbitrary calculations, testing functions, etc.
	- SELECT 2 + 3 * 4 FROM DUAL;
	- SELECT NOW() FROM DUAL;
	- SELECT USER(), DATABASE() FROM DUAL;
- In MySQL, DUAL keyword is optional.
	- SELECT 2 + 3 * 4;
	- SELECT NOW();
	- SELECT USER(), DATABASE();
	
# SQL functions
- RDBMS provides many built-in functions to process the data.
- These functions can be classified as:
	- Single row functions	
	- One row input produce one row output.
	- e.g. ABS(), CONCAT(), IFNULL(), …
- Multi-row or Group functions
	- Values from multiple rows are aggregated to single value.
	- e.g. SUM(), MIN(), MAX(), …
- These functions can also be categorized based on data types or usage.
	- Numeric functions
	- String functions
	- Date and Time functions
	- Control flow functions
	- Information functions
	- Miscellaneous functions




# Numeric & String functions
- ABS()
- POWER()
- ROUND(), FLOOR(), CEIL()
- ASCII(), CHAR()
- CONCAT()
- SUBSTRING()
- LOWER(), UPPER()
- TRIM(), LTRIM(), RTRIM()
- LPAD(), RPAD()
- REGEXP_LIKE()

# Date-Time and Information functions
- VERSION()
- USER(), DATABASE()
- MySQL supports multiple date time related data types
	- DATE (3), TIME (3), DATETIME (5), TIMESTAMP (4), YEAR (1)
- SYSDATE(), NOW()
- DATE(), TIME()
- DAYOFMONTH(), MONTH(), YEAR(), HOUR(), MINUTE(), SECOND(), …
- DATEDIFF(), DATE_ADD(), TIMEDIFF()
- MAKEDATE(), MAKETIME()

# Control and NULL and List functions
- NULL is special value in RDBMS that represents absence of value in that column.
- NULL values do not work with relational operators and need to use special operators.
- Most of functions return NULL if NULL value is passed as one of its argument.
- ISNULL()
- IFNULL()
- NULLIF()
- COALESCE()
- GREATEST(), LEAST()
- IF(condition, true-value, false-value)

# Group functions
- Work on group of rows of table.
- Input to function is data from multiple rows & then output is single row. Hence these functions are called as "Multi Row Function“ or "Group Functions“.
- These functions are used to perform aggregate ops like sum, avg, max, min, count or std dev, etc. Hence these fns are also called as "Aggregate Functions".
- Example: SUM(), AVG(), MAX(), MIN(), COUNT().
- NULL values are ignored by group functions.
- Limitations of GROUP functions:

	- Cannot select group function along with a column.
	- Cannot select group function along with a single row fn.
	- Cannot use group function in WHERE clause/condition.
	- Cannot nest a group function in another group fn.
	
# GROUP BY clause
- GROUP BY is used for analysis of data i.e. generating reports & charts.
- When GROUP BY single column, generated output can be used to plot 2-D chart. When GROUP BY two column, generated output can be used toplot 3-D chart and so on.
- GROUP BY queries are also called as Multi-dimensional / Spatial queries.
- Syntactical Characteristics:
	- If a column is used for GROUP BY, then it may or may not be used in SELECT clause.
	- If a column is in SELECT, it must be in GROUP BY.
- When GROUP BY query is fired on database server, it does following:
	- Load data from server disk into server RAM.
	- Sort data on group by columns.
	- Group similar records by group columns.
	- Perform given aggregate ops on each column.
	- Send result to client.
	
# # Transaction
- Transaction is set of DML queries executed as a single unit.
- Transaction examples
	- accounts table [id, type, balance]
	- UPDATE accounts SET balance=balance-1000 WHERE id = 1;
	- UPDATE accounts SET balance=balance+1000 WHERE id = 2;
- RDBMS transaction have ACID properties.
	- Atomicity
		- All queries are executed as a single unit. If any query is failed, other queries are discarded.
	- Consistency
		- When transaction is completed, all clients see the same data.
	- Isolation
		- Multiple transactions (by same or multiple clients) are processed concurrently.
	- Durable
		- When transaction is completed, all data is saved on disk.
- Transaction management
	- START TRANSACTION;
	- COMMIT WORK;
	- START TRANSACTION;
	- ROLLBACK WORK;
- In MySQL autocommit variable is by default 1. So each DML command is auto- committed into database.
	- SELECT @@autocommit;
- Changing autocommit to 0, will create new transaction immediately after current transaction is completed. This setting can be made permanent in config file.
	- SET autocommit=0;
	
- Save-point is state of database tables (data) at the moment (within a transaction).
- It is advised to create save-points at end of each logical section of work.
- Database user may choose to rollback to any of the save-point.
- Transaction management with Save-points

```	
- START TRANSACTION;
- …
- SAVEPOINT sa1;
- …
- SAVEPOINT sa2;
- …
- ROLLBACK TO sa1;
- …
- COMMIT; // or ROLLBACK
```

- Commit always commit the whole transaction.
- ROLLBACK or COMMIT clears all save-points.
- Transaction is set of DML statements.
- If any DDL statement is executed, current transaction is automatically committed.
- Any power failure, system or network failure automatically rollback current state.
- Transactions are isolated from each other and are consistent.

# Row locking
- When an user update or delete a row (within a transaction), that row is locked and becomes read-only for other users.
- The other users see old row values, until transaction is committed by first user.
- If other users try to modify or delete such locked row, their transaction processing is blocked until row is unlocked.
- Other users can INSERT into that table. Also they can UPDATE or DELETE other rows.
- The locks are automatically released when COMMIT/ROLLBACK is done by the user.
- This whole process is done automatically in MySQL. It is called as "OPTIMISTIC LOCKING".
- Manually locking the row in advanced before issuing UPDATE or DELETE is known as "PESSIMISTIC LOCKING".
- This is done by appending FOR UPDATE to the SELECT query.
- It will lock all selected rows, until transaction is committed or rollbacked.
- If these rows are already locked by another users, the SELECT operationm is blocked until rows lock is released.
- By default MySQL does table locking. Row locking is possible only when table is indexed on the column.


# Entity Relations
- To avoid redundancy of the data, data should be organized into multiple tables so that tables are related to each other.
- The relations can be one of the following
	- One to One
	- One to Many
	- Many to One
	- Many to Many
- Entity relations is outcome of Normalization process.

![dbt](https://github.com/shreeshailaya/C-DAC-Notes/blob/main/Database%20technologies/Media/2_joins.png)
- Join statements are used to SELECT data from multiple tables using single query.
- Typical RDBMS supports following types of joins:
	- Cross Join
	- Inner Join
	- Left Outer Join
	- Right Outer Join
	- Full Outer Join
	- Self join
	
![dbt](https://github.com/shreeshailaya/C-DAC-Notes/blob/main/Database%20technologies/Media/3_joins.png)

# Cross Joins 
![dbt](https://github.com/shreeshailaya/C-DAC-Notes/blob/main/Database%20technologies/Media/4_joins.png)
- Compares each row of Table1 with every row of Table2.
- Yields all possible combinations of Table1 and Table2.
- In MySQL, The larger table is referred as "Driving Table", while smaller table is referred as "Driven Table". Each row of Driving table is combined with every row of Driven table.
- Cross join is the fastest join, because there is no condition check involved.


# Inner Join

![dbt](https://github.com/shreeshailaya/C-DAC-Notes/blob/main/Database%20technologies/Media/4_joins.png)
- The inner JOIN is used to return rows from both tables that satisfy the join condition.
- Non-matching rows from both tables are skipped.
- If join condition contains equality check, it is referred as equi-join; otherwise it is non-equi-join.

# Left Outer Join
![dbt](https://github.com/shreeshailaya/C-DAC-Notes/blob/main/Database%20technologies/Media/4_joins.png)
- Left outer join is used to return matching rows from both tables along with additional rows in left table.
- Corresponding to additional rows in left table, right table values are taken as NULL.
- Corresponding to additional rows in left table, right table values are taken as NULL.

# Right Outer Join
![dbt](https://github.com/shreeshailaya/C-DAC-Notes/blob/main/Database%20technologies/Media/4_joins.png)
- Right outer join is used to return matching rows from both tables along with additional rows in right table.
- Corresponding to additional rows in right table, left table values are taken as NULL.
- OUTER keyword is optional.

# Full Outer Join
![dbt](https://github.com/shreeshailaya/C-DAC-Notes/blob/main/Database%20technologies/Media/4_joins.png)

- Full join is used to return matching rows from both tables along with additional rows in both tables.
- Corresponding to additional rows in left or right table, opposite table values are taken as NULL.
- Full outer join is not supported in MySQL, but can be simulated using set operators.


# Set Operators
![dbt](https://github.com/shreeshailaya/C-DAC-Notes/blob/main/Database%20technologies/Media/5_joins.png)
- UNION operator is used to combine results of two queries. The common data is taken only
once. It can be used to simulate full outer join.
- UNION ALL operator is used to combine results of two queries. Common data is repeated.

# Self Joins 
![dbt](https://github.com/shreeshailaya/C-DAC-Notes/blob/main/Database%20technologies/Media/6_joins.png)
- When join is done on same table, then it is known as "Self Join". The both columns in condition belong to the same table.
- Self join may be an inner join or outer join.

# Multi-table Joins
![dbt](https://github.com/shreeshailaya/C-DAC-Notes/blob/main/Database%20technologies/Media/7_joins.png)

# Sub queries
- Sub-query is query within query. Typically it work with SELECT statements.
- Output of inner query is used as input to outer query.
- If no optimization is enabled, for each row of outer query result, sub-query is executed once. This reduce performance of sub-query.
- Single row sub-query
	- Sub-query returns single row.
	- Usually it is compared in outer query using relational operators.
- Multi-row sub-query
	- Sub-query returns multiple rows.
	- Usually it is compared in outer query using operators like IN, ANY or ALL.
	- IN operator checks for equality with results from sub-queries.
	- ANY operator compares with one of the result from sub-queries.
	- ALL operator compares with all the results from sub-queries.


- Correlated sub-query
	- If number of results from sub-query are reduced, query performance will increase.
	- This can be done by adding criteria (WHERE clause) in sub-query based on outer query row.
	- Typically correlated sub-query use IN, ALL, ANY and EXISTS operators.
- Sub queries with UPDATE and DELETE are not supported in all RDBMS.
- In MySQL, Sub-queries in UPDATE/DELETE is allowed, but sub-query should not SELECT from the same table, on which UPDATE/DELETE operation is in progress.

# Views
- RDBMS view represents view (projection) of the data.
- View is based on SELECT statement.
- Typically it is restricted view of the data (limited rows or columns) from one or more
tables (joins and/or sub-queries) or summary of the data (grouping).
- Data of view is not stored on server hard-disk; but its SELECT statement is stored in
compiled form. It speed up execution of view.

- Views are of two types: Simple view and Complex view
- Usually if view contains computed columns, group by, joins or sub-queries, then the
views are said to be complex. DML operations are not supported on these views.
- DML operations on view affects underlying table.
- View can be created with CHECK OPTION to ensure that DML operations can be performed only the data visible in that view.
- Views can be differentiated with: SHOW FULL TABLES.
- Views can be dropped with DROP VIEW statement.
- View can be based on another view.

- Applications of views
	- Security: Providing limited access to the data.
	- Hide source code of the table.
	- Simplifies complex queries.

# Data Control Language
- Security is built-in feature of any RDBMS. It is implemented in terms of permissions (a.k.a. privileges).
- There are two types of privileges.
- System privileges
	- Privileges for certain commands i.e. CREATE, ALTER, DROP, ...
	- Typically these privileges are given to the database administrator or higher authority user.
- Object privileges
	- RDBMS objects are table, view, stored procedure, function, triggers, …
	- Can perform operations on the objects i.e. INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT, CALL, ...
	- Typically these privileges are given to the database users.
- Permissions are given to user using GRANT command.
	- GRANT CREATE ON db.* TO user@host;
	- GRANT CREATE ON *.* TO user1@host, user2@host;
	- GRANT SELECT ON db.table TO user@host;
	- GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON db.table TO user@host;
	- GRANT ALL ON db.* TO user@host;
- By default one user cannot give permissions to other user. This can be enabled using WITH GRANT OPTION.
	- GRANT ALL ON *.* TO user@host WITH GRANT OPTION;
- Permissions assigned to any user can be withdrawn using REVOKE command.
	- REVOKE SELECT, INSERT ON db.table FROM user@host;
- Permissions can be activated by FLUSH PRIVILEGES.
	- System GRANT tables are reloaded by this command. Auto done after GRANT, REVOKE.
	- Command is necessary is GRANT tables are modified using DML operations.
# Index
- Index enable faster searching in tables by indexed columns.
- CREATE INDEX idx_name ON table(column);
- One table can have multiple indexes on different columns/order.
- Typically indexes are stored as some data structure (like BTREE or HASH) on disk.
- Indexes are updated during DML operations. So DML operation are slower on indexed tables.
- Index can be ASC or DESC.
	- It cause storage of key values in respective order (MySQL 8.x onwards).
	- ASC/DESC index is used by optimizer on ORDER BY queries.
- There are four types of indexes:

- Simple index
	- CREATE INDEX idx_name ON table(column [ASC|DESC]);
- Unique index
	- CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_name ON table(column [ASC|DESC]);
	- Doesn’t allow duplicate values.
- Composite index
	- CREATE INDEX idx_name ON table(column1 [ASC|DESC], column2 [ASC|DESC]);
	- Composite index can also be unique. Do not allow duplicate combination of columns.
- Clustered index
	- PRIMARY index automatically created on Primary key for row lookup.
	- If primary key is not available, hidden index is created on synthetic column.
	- It is maintained in tabular form and its reference is used in other indexes.
	
	
- Indexes should be created on shorter (INT, CHAR, …) columns to save disk space.
- Few RDBMS do not allow indexes on external columns i.e. TEXT, BLOB.
