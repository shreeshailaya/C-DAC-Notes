# Day-1 16/6(Introduction)
- It is used in designing
- It is abstract data type
- It has some set of rules that we cannot change 
- We uses DS for abstract data type

- What is data structure?
 Defination -> working -> real life example 
 - In computer terms a ds is a specific way to store and organize data in computers memory so that these data can be used efficiently later
 - It belong to structuring the data 
 
 - Need of Data Structure
	 - Effiency
	 - Reusability
	 - Abstraction

- There is two types of DS
	- Linear 
	- Non-Linearas
- Linear 
	- Array
	- Queue
	- Stack
	- Linked list
- Non Linear
	- Graph 
	- Tree

# Day-2 17/6(Array,Linkedlist)

### Array 
 
```java
class Student
{
	private int rollno;
	private string name;
	private int marks;
	
	public Student()
	{
	}
	
	public Student(int rollno, String name, int marks)
	{
		this.name=name;
		this.rollno=rollno;
		this.name=name;
	}
	
	public void accept()
	{
		Scanner sc =new Scanner(System.in);
		Syso(name,rollno,marks);
		sc=name,rollno,marks;
	}
	
	public void display()
	{
		System.out.println(name,rollno,name);
	}
}
```


![array](https://github.com/shreeshailaya/c-dac/blob/main/Data%20structure/Media/1_array.png)


```java
class Team
{
	private int size;
	Student s[];
	
	public Team(int size)
	{
		this.size=size;
		s=new Student[size];
		for(int i=0;i<size;i++)
			s[i]=new Student();
	}
	
	public void accept()
	{
		for(int i=0;i<size;i++)
			s[i].accept();
	}
	
	
	public void display()
	{
		for(int i=0;i<size;i++)
			s[i].display();
	}

}

```

```java 

class Program
{
	public ststic void main(String [] arr)
	{
		Team cri = new Team(11);
		cri.accept();
		cri.display();
		
		
		Team kabadi = new Team(7);
		kabadi.accept();
		kabadi.display();
	}

}

```

### Linked List 

- It is Linear Data Structure 
- It connected via links 

- Disadventage of Array
	- Slow searching in array so linked list come 
	- Inseration and deletion is slow in array
	- fixed size in array
	- memory weastage in array
- Because of this disadvantages of array linked list is come in picture	
- In other hand linked list able to grow in size as needed
- Does not required the shifting of items during inseration or deletion.
- Each data value is linked with address of next value
- Each element is called node 
- Data values need not be stored in adjacent memory cell

- Structure of Linked List
```java
class Node
{
	private int data;
	private Node next; 	//Next  is data member which will hold the referance of next variable
	
	// One linked list may have multiple node  
	public Node()
	{
		data=0;
		next=null;
	}
	
	public void display()
	{
		syso(data);
	}
}
class Linkedlist
{
	Node head;
	createNode(int data);
	createLinkedList(int numberOfNodes);
}	

class Program()
{
	PSVM(	)
	{
		Linkedlist l1= new Linkedlist();
		l1.createLinklist(5);
		l1.display();
	}
}
```

- Linked list real program
- link = next;

![linkedList](https://github.com/shreeshailaya/c-dac/blob/main/Data%20structure/Media/4_linkedList.png)


```java

public class Linkedlist
{
	private Node head;
	public Linkledlist()
	{
		head=null;
		
	}
	
	public void createLinkedlist(int terms)
	{
		int data =5;
		int i;
		node newnode=null,move=null;
		for(int i=1;i<=term;i++)
		{
			newnode=new Node(data); //create new node 
			if(head==null)	
				head=newnode;
			else
			{
				move=head;
				while(move.getNext())!=null)
				{
					move=move.getNext();
				}
				move.setLink(newnode);
			}
			data=data+5;
		}
		
	}
	
	public void display()
	{
		Node move=head;
		while(move!=null)
		{
			System.out.println("  "+move.getData());
			move=move.getLink();
		}
	}
}
```
![linkedList](https://github.com/shreeshailaya/c-dac/blob/main/Data%20structure/Media/5_linkedList.gif)

- Inseration in linked list

```
move.setLink(newnode);

```
![linkedList](https://github.com/shreeshailaya/c-dac/blob/main/Data%20structure/Media/6_linkedList.gif)

- Steps for creating Linked List
	- Ask user number of nodes to insert
	- Create node first
	- First check whether the linklist is empty or not, if linklist is empty this node will be first node so assign this node as head 
	- Otherwise travel the linkedlist till the end and attach node at end.
	- Repeat these steps till number of nodes user entered

# Day 4 19/6(Searching algorithms)
- Searching algorithms 
### Linear Search
- In Linear search, we search an element or value in a given array by traversing the array from the starting, till the desired element or value is found.
- It compares the element to be searched with all the elements present in the array and when the element is matched successfully, it returns the index of the element in the array, else it return -1.
- Linear Search is applied on unsorted or unordered lists, when there are fewer elements in a list.

![Linear Search](https://github.com/nayan1xyz/C-DAC-Notes/blob/main/Data%20structure/Media/1_linearsearch.gif)

#### Algorithm
    
  
    Linear Search ( Array A, Value x)
    Step 1: Set i to 1
    Step 2: if i > n then go to step 7
    Step 3: if A[i] = x then go to step 6
    Step 4: Set i to i + 1
    Step 5: Go to Step 2
    Step 6: Print Element x Found at index i and go to step 8
    Step 7: Print element not found
    Step 8: Exit

	
#### 	Pseudo code for linear search
    LinearSearch(list, target_element):
    {
        INITIALIZE index = 0
        WHILE (index < number of items in the list)
        {
            IF (list[index] == target element)
            {
                RETURN index
            }
            INCREMENT index by 1
        }
        RETURN -1
    }
#### Code for Linear Search
```cpp
#include < iostream >
  using namespace std;

void linearSearch(int a[], int n) {
  int temp = -1;

  for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    if (a[i] == n) {
      cout << "Element found at position: " << i + 1 << endl;
      temp = 0;
      break;
    }
  }

  if (temp == -1) {
    cout << "No Element Found" << endl;
  }

}

int main() {
  int arr[5];
  cout << "Please enter 5 elements of the Array" << endl;
  for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    cin >> arr[i];
  }
  cout << "Please enter an element to search" << endl;
  int num;
  cin >> num;

  linearSearch(arr, num);

  return 0;
}
```
#### Time and Space Complexity
- Best Time Complexity: O(1)
- Average Time Complexity: O(n)
- Worst Time Complexity:  O(n)
- Best Space Complexity: O(1)

### Binary Search
- Binary search begins by comparing the middle element of the list with the target element. If the target value matches the middle element, its position in the list is returned. If it does not match, the list is divided into two halves.

- The first half consists of the first element to middle element whereas the second half consists of the element next to the middle element to the last element.  If target value is greater than middle element, first half is discarded. Then same steps follow on until we find the target value’s position.

![Binary Search](https://github.com/nayan1xyz/C-DAC-Notes/blob/main/Data%20structure/Media/1_binarysearch.gif)
#### Algorithm
    function binary_search(A, n, T) is
        L := 0
        R := n − 1
        while L ≤ R do
            m := floor((L + R) / 2)
            if A[m] < T then
                L := m + 1
            else if A[m] > T then
                R := m − 1
            else:
                return m
        return unsuccessful

#### Pseudo code for binary search
```cpp
BinarySearch(array, target):
{
    left = lowestBound(array)
    right = highestBound(array)
    WHILE (left <= right)
    {
        middle = (left + right) / 2
        if(target = array[middle])
            RETURN middle
        else if(target < array[middle])
           right = middle - 1
        else
           left = middle + 1
    }
    RETURN -1
}
```
#### C++ Code for Binary Search  
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int binarySearch(int[], int, int, int);

int main()
{
   int num[10] = {10, 22, 37, 55, 92, 118};
   int search_num, loc=-1;

   cout<<"Enter the number that you want to search: ";
   cin>>search_num;

   loc = binarySearch(num, 0, 6, search_num);

   if(loc != -1)
   {
      cout<<search_num<<" found in the array at the location: "<<loc;
   }
   else
   {
      cout<<"Element not found";
   }
   return 0;
}

int binarySearch(int a[], int first, int last, int search_num)
{
   int middle;
   if(last >= first)
   {
      middle = (first + last)/2;
      //Checking if the element is present at middle loc
      if(a[middle] == search_num)
      {
         return middle+1;
      }

      //Checking if the search element is present in greater half
      else if(a[middle] < search_num)
      {
         return binarySearch(a,middle+1,last,search_num);
      }

      //Checking if the search element is present in lower half
      else
      {
         return binarySearch(a,first,middle-1,search_num);
      }

   }
   return -1;
}

- Average Time Complexity: O(log n)
- Worst Time Complexity:  O(log n)

# Day 6 22/6(Stack,Dynamaic Stack,Reverse String using Stack)
### Stack 
- Some functions in stact
- peak()
- isFull()
- push 
- pop

- push()
1. Check stack is full.
2. if the stack is full produce an error and exit
3. is the stack is not full increment top to point next empty space
4. adds data element to the stack locationwhere top is pointing
5. return success

![linkedList](https://github.com/shreeshailaya/c-dac/blob/main/Data%20structure/Media/16_stack.gif)

- pop()

1. Checks if the stack is empty
2. if the stack is empty produce error and exit
3. if the stack is not empty access the data element at which top is pointing
4. decrease the value of top by  1
5. return success


```java
class MyStack
{
private int top,size;
private int arr[];

	public MyStack()
	{
		size=3;
		top=-1;
		arr=new int[size];
	}
	
	public MyStack(int size)
	{
		this.size=size;
		top=-1;
		arr=new int[size];
	}
	
	public boolean isEmpty()
	{
		if(top==-1)
		{
			return true;
		}
		else
		{
			return false;
		}
	}
	
	public boolean isFull()
	{
		if(top==size-1)
			return true;
		else
			return false;
	}
	
	
	public void push(int element)
	{
		if(isFull==true)
		{
			syso("Stack is full");
			return;
		}
		else
		{
			top++;	//increment top
			arr[top]=element;
		}	
	}
	
	// it is mandatery that we have to pass paramert to push 
	
	public int pop()
	{
		int element=-9999;
		if(isEmpty()==false)
		{
			element= arr[top];
			top--;
		}else
		{
			syso("Stack is empty")
		}
		return element;
	}
	
	public void display()
	{
		syso("*** Stack is ***");
		for(int i=top;i>=0;i--)
		{
			syso("   "arr[i]);
		}
	}
}

```

- Push take parameter
- pop return parameter
- so pop always return something


### Dynamaic Stack (LikeList stack)
- Create Node class
	- data and next
	- default constructor 
	- para constructor 
	- getter setter
	- toString/display()
- Create MyClass
	- having top as Node data type
	- default Constructor-assign null to top
	- implement is empty method which will return status  whether stack is empty or not
	if top is null then stack is empty
	- push method will take data as parameter 
	```
		create newnode
		if top isnull
			newnode become top
		else
			add newnode at beg
			assign top as new node
	```
	- pop()
	- check is stack is not empty
	- mark first node as del
	- move top to next node 
	- get del.data into data
	- assign del is null
	if empty stack return 99999
	
	- display()
	- assign move=top
	- displaymove.data
	- increment or shift move to next node.
	- repeat till move !=null;

```java

class Node
{
	private char data;
	private Node next;
	
	publuc Node()
	{
		data="0";
		next=null;
	}
	public Node(char ch)
	{
		this.data=ch;
		next=null;
	}
	
	public String toString()
	{
		return "  "+data;
	}
	
	//gettersetter
}

class MyStack
{
	Node top;
	public MyStack()
	{
		top=null;
	}
	public boolean isEmpty()
	{
		if(top==null)
		{
			return true;
		}else{
			return false;
		}
	}
	
	public void push(char ch)
	{
		Node newnode=new Node(ch);
		if(top==null)
		{
			top=newnode;
		}
		else
		{
			newnode.setNext(top);
			top=newnode;
		}
	}
	
	public char pop()
	{
		char data='0';
		Node del=null;
		if(isEmpty()==false)
		{
			del=top;
			data=del.getData();
			top=top.getNext();
			del=null;
		}
		
		return data;
	}
	
	public String toString()
	{
		String str="";
		Node move=top;
		while(move!=null)
		{
			str=str+"\n\t"+move.getData();
			move=move.getNext();	
			return str;

# Day 14 1/7(Hash,time complixity,kruskal Algorithm,Prime's Algo,AVL Tree Balanced Factor)
### Hash
**Definition:** It is a process of converting an input of any length into a fixed size string of text using a mathematical function. 

![HASH FUNCTION](https://github.com/shreeshailaya/C-DAC-Notes/blob/main/Data%20structure/Media/25_hashFunction.png)

There are many formulas to Hash such as SHA.

**Why do we need Hashing?**

In a large array of values, it is difficult to search for a particular item in an array. 
We would need to do a binary search. However, if we are aware of the index of the element, it is easier to retrieve the element itself. 

For example: 
We need to find “Thiru” in the following array: 
Sven, Anna, Mia, Olaf, Thiru, Jaya, Amit, Harry, Rupert, Justin

We would need to iterate through each element to check if the element matches “Thiru”. 

Alternatively, had we known the index of Thiru, It would have been easier to access. 

In the following array:

Sven, 
Anna, 
Mia, 
Olaf, 
Thir, 
Jaya, 
Amit, 
Harr, 
Rupe, 
Just, 


Array(4) would have fetched us “Thiru”. 
We could further devise a function which could create a relationship between the value and the index we store values in.

Let the function we used to find the index to store the value be = Sum of the ASCII of the word mod the size of the array

For Sven: ASCII of S + ASCII of v + ASCII of e + ASCII of n
	= 115 + 118 + 101 + 110
	=444

The size of the array is 10. Thus 444 mod 10 is 4. 
| Index       | Element          |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| 0     | - |
| 1    | -     |
| 2 | -     |
| 3 | -      |
| 4 | Sven      |
| 5 | -      |
| 6 | -      |
| 7 | -      |
| 8 | -      |
| 9 | -      |


Similarly for Mia, Sum of ASCII = 77 + 105 + 97
				  = 279 % 10 (size of the array ) = 9

The element “Mia” would go in the 9th index of the array

| Index       | Element          |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| 0     | - |
| 1    | -     |
| 2 | -     |
| 3 | -      |
| 4 | Sven      |
| 5 | -      |
| 6 | -      |
| 7 | -      |
| 8 | -      |
| 9 | Mia     |

Similarly, 
The following are the ASCII sum
| String       | ASCII sum         |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Mia    | 279|
| Anna   | 382    |
| Olaf   | 386    |
| Thiru  | 524     |
| Jaya   | 389      |
| Amit   | 395     |
| Harry  | 518     |
| Rupert | 642     |
| Justin | 637     |

| String       | ASCII sum % 10         |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Mia    | 9 |
| Anna   |  2    |
| Olaf   |  6    |
| Thiru  |   4     |
| Jaya   |  9      |
| Amit   |  5     |
| Harry  |   8     |
| Rupert |  2     |
| Justin | 7     |


Anna goes to the 2nd row, Olaf to the 6th. But Thiru and Sven have the same index. This is known as collision i.e two or more keys are mapped to same value. 

One solution to **collision** is to insert Thiru in the next index i.e is the 5th index. 

Another solution to the problem is to use **Chain Hashing**.  The idea is to make each cell of the hash table point to a linked list of records that have the same hash function value.
![CHAIN HASHING](https://github.com/shreeshailaya/C-DAC-Notes/blob/main/Data%20structure/Media/26_chainHashing.png?raw=true)

We have different ways to achieve Hashing. Few of them are described below
| Data Structure      |Description        | 
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| HashTable    | Synchronised  |
| HashMap     | - Non-Synchronised, Faster|
| LinkedHashMap |Keeps the order of inserts    |
| ConcurrentHashMap |Synchronised, Faster as locks are used    |
| HashSet |Maintains only keys   |
| LinkedHashSet |Keeps the order of inserts, Maintains only Key   |

**Universal Hashing**

Let H be a finite collection of hash functions that map a given universe U of keys into the range {0, 1..... m-1}. Such a collection is said to be universal if for each pair of distinct keys k,l∈U, the number of hash functions h∈ H for which h(k)= h(l) is at most |H|/m. In other words, with a hash function randomly chosen from H, the chance of a collision between distinct keys k and l is no more than the chance 1/m of a collision if h(k) and h(l)were randomly and independently chosen from the set {0,1,...m-1}.
**Rehashing**


In case the hash table becomes nearly full, the running time for the operations of will start taking too much time, insert operation may fail in such situation, the best possible solution is as follows:
Create a new hash table double in size.
Scan the original hash table, compute new hash value and insert into the new hash table.
Free the memory occupied by the original hash table.
 
 **Example in Java for an HashMap**: 

 ```java
 import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

//Given a string, count the frequency/occurence of each Character
public class FindTheOccurenceOfCharacter {
    static HashMap<Character, Integer> getOccurence(String inputString) {
        HashMap<Character, Integer> characterFrequencyMap
        = new HashMap<Character, Integer>();


    char[] inputArray = inputString.toLowerCase().toCharArray();

    for (char character : inputArray) {
        if (characterFrequencyMap.containsKey(character)) {
            characterFrequencyMap.put(character, characterFrequencyMap.get(character) + 1);
        }
        else {
            characterFrequencyMap.put(character, 1);
        }
    }

    return characterFrequencyMap;
    }

    static void  printOccurence(HashMap<Character, Integer> map){
        for (Map.Entry<Character, Integer> value: map.entrySet()) {
            System.out.println(value.getKey() + "->" + value.getValue());
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String inputString = "Test";

        HashMap<Character, Integer> map = getOccurence(inputString);

        printOccurence(map);
        
    }
}
 ```


# Time Complixity 
Time complexity is defined as the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of the length of the input. It measures the time taken to execute each statement of code in an algorithm. It is not going to examine the total execution time of an algorithm.
So, if computing 10 elements take 1 second, computing 100 elements takes 2 seconds, 1000 elements take 3 seconds, and so on.

## What are the Different Types of Time complexity Notation Used?
As we have seen, Time complexity is given by time as a function of the length of the input. And, there exists a relation between the input data size (n) and the number of operations performed (N) with respect to time. This relation is denoted as Order of growth in Time complexity and given notation O[n] where O is the order of growth and n is the length of the input. It is also called as ‘Big O Notation’

Big O Notation expresses the run time of an algorithm in terms of how quickly it grows relative to the input ‘n’ by defining the N number of operations that are done on it. Thus, the time complexity of an algorithm is denoted by the combination of all O[n] assigned for each line of function.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83773953/194246720-a07cfe73-c069-4173-bff8-20ab7faa9052.png)

There are different types of time complexities used, let’s see one by one:

1. Constant time – O (1)

2. Linear time – O (n)

3. Logarithmic time – O (log n)

4. Quadratic time – O (n^2)

5. Cubic time – O (n^3) 

and many more complex notations like Exponential time, Quasilinear time, factorial time, etc. are used based on the type of functions defined.

## Lets Understand With Some Examples:
``` java 
import java.io.*;

class TC {
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		System.out.print("Hello World");
	}
}

output : Hello World
```
Time Complexity: In the above code “Hello World” is printed only once on the screen. 
So, the time complexity is constant: O(1) i.e. every time a constant amount of time is required to execute code, no matter which operating system or which machine configurations you are using. 

``` java 
class TC {
 
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        int i, n = 8;
        for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            System.out.printf("Hello World !!!\n");
        }
    }
}

Output :

Hello World !!!
Hello World !!!
Hello World !!!
Hello World !!!
Hello World !!!
Hello World !!!
Hello World !!!
Hello World !!!
```
Time Complexity: In the above code “Hello World !!!” is printed only n times on the screen, as the value of n can change. 
So, the time complexity is linear: O(n) i.e. every time, a linear amount of time is required to execute code.

## Comparison of functions on the basis of time complexity 

It follows the following order in case of time complexity: 

O(nn) > O(n!) > O(n3) > O(n2) > O(n.log(n)) > O(n.log(log(n))) > O(n) > O(sqrt(n)) > O(log(n)) > O(1) 

Note: Reverse is the order for better performance of a code with corresponding time complexity, i.e. a program with less time complexity is more efficient. 

## Space Complexity 
Space complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by a program to run as a function of length of the input. It is directly proportional to the largest memory your program acquires at any instance during run time. 
For example: int consumes 4 bytes of memory.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83773953/194251611-437a7482-3c4d-4070-ad11-550a4bcb45c7.png)

## How Significant Are Space and Time Complexity?

Significant in Terms of Time Complexity
The input size has a strong relationship with time complexity. As the size of the input increases, so does the runtime, or the amount of time it takes the algorithm to run.

## Here is an example.

Assume you have a set of numbers S= (10, 50, 20, 15, 30)

There are numerous algorithms for sorting the given numbers. However, not all of them are effective. To determine which is the most effective, you must perform computational analysis on each algorithm.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83773953/194253255-b69b6b37-fc60-4e16-844e-1c569f5a071e.png) 

## Here are some of the most critical findings from the graph:

* This test revealed the following sorting algorithms: Quicksort, Insertion sort, Bubble sort, and Heapsort.
* Python is the programming language used to complete the task, and the input size ranges from 50 to 500 characters.
* The results were as follows: "Heap Sort algorithms performed well despite the length of the lists; on the other hand, you discovered that Insertion sort and Bubble sort algorithms performed far worse, significantly increasing computing time." See the graph above for the results.
* Before you can run an analysis on any algorithm, you must first determine its stability. Understanding your data is the most important aspect of conducting a successful analysis.

## Time Complexity vs. Space Complexity
You now understand space and time complexity fundamentals and how to calculate it for an algorithm or program. In this section, you will summarise all previous discussions and list the key differences in a table.

|     Time Complexity                 |     Space Complexity |
| ------------------------------------| ---------------------|
|Calculates the time required         | Estimates the space memory required  |
|Time is counted for all statements   | Memory space is counted for all variables, inputs, and outputs.|
|The size of the input data is the primary determinant. | Primarily determined by the auxiliary variable size|
| More crucial in terms of solution optimization | More essential in terms of solution optimization| 

### kruskal Algorithm
**Defenition:** Kruskal's Algorithm is used to find the minimum spanning tree for a connected weighted graph.
**Minimum Spanning Tree** Contains all the vertices in the graph but has the minimum sum of weights among all the trees that can be formed from the graph.

**How does it work**

Kruskal's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds a local optimum as an initiation step to find the global optimum. 

The steps for implementing Kruskal's algorithm are as follows:

**1.** Sort all the edges from low weight to high.

**2.** Take the edge with the lowest weight and add it to the spanning tree. If adding the edge created a cycle, then reject this edge.

**3.** Keep adding edges until all vertices are reached.

Let us consider a graph. Now the minimum spanning tree using Kruskal's algorithm can be created as follows

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Blaize99/C-DAC-Notes/main/Data%20structure/Media/ka-6.webp)

**Time Complexity:** This algorithm has a time complexity of O(e*log(e)) where e is the number of edges in the graph

For the code snipet the weight of the edges are as given below.

|Edge  |0-1|0-2|1-2|2-3|2-5|2-4|3-4|5-4|
|Weight| 4 | 4 | 2 | 5 | 2 | 4 | 3 | 3 |

Next step is to sort the table according to the ascending order of the weights

Which will given the following result.

|Edge  |1-2|2-5|3-4|5-4|0-1|0-2|2-4|2-3|
|Weight| 2 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 5 |

**Defenition:** Prim's algorithm is used to find the minimum spanning tree from a graph. This algorithm gives the same output as that of the Kruskal Algorithm. 

**How does it work** 
Like Kruskal's algorithm Prim's algoritm is also a greedy algorithm.

The steps for implementing Prim's algorithm are as follows:

**1.** Initialize the minimun spanning tree by choosing a random vertex from the graph.

**2.** Add to the spanning tree the vertex which is connectd to the first vertex with least weight.

**3.** Keep choosing the next nearest (lowest weight) vertex not in the spanning tree.

**4.** Repeat step 3 util the spanning tree has all the vertices as in the original graph.

Let us consider a graph. Prim's algorithm finds the minimum spanning tree as follows

**Time complexity** The time complexity of Prim's algorithm is O(e*log(v)) where e is the number of edges in the graph and v the number of vertices in the graph.

For the code snippet weight of each edges of the graph are as given below

|Edge  |0-1|0-2|1-2|1-3|1-4|2-3|2-4|3-4|
|Weight| 9 | 75| 95| 19| 42| 51| 66| 31|

```java
// Prim's Algorithm
import java.util.Arrays;

class PGraph {

  public void Prim(int G[][], int V) {

    int INF = 9999999;

    int no_edge; // number of edge

    // create a array to track selected vertex
    // selected will become true otherwise false
    boolean[] selected = new boolean[V];

    // set selected false initially
    Arrays.fill(selected, false);

    // set number of edge to 0
    no_edge = 0;

    // the number of egde in minimum spanning tree will be
    // always less than (V -1), where V is number of vertices in
    // graph

    // choose 0th vertex and make it true
    selected[0] = true;

    // print for edge and weight
    System.out.println("Edge : Weight");

    while (no_edge < V - 1) {
      // For every vertex in the set S, find the all adjacent vertices
      // , calculate the distance from the vertex selected at step 1.
      // if the vertex is already in the set S, discard it otherwise
      // choose another vertex nearest to selected vertex at step 1.

      int min = INF;
      int x = 0; // row number
      int y = 0; // col number

      for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
        if (selected[i] == true) {
          for (int j = 0; j < V; j++) {
            // not in selected and there is an edge
            if (!selected[j] && G[i][j] != 0) {
              if (min > G[i][j]) {
                min = G[i][j];
                x = i;
                y = j;
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
      System.out.println(x + " - " + y + " :  " + G[x][y]);
      selected[y] = true;
      no_edge++;
    }
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    PGraph g = new PGraph();
    // number of vertices in grapj
    int V = 5;
    // create a 2d array of size 5x5
    // the adjacency matrix to represent graph
    int[][] G = { { 0, 9, 75, 0, 0 }, { 9, 0, 95, 19, 42 }, { 75, 95, 0, 51, 66 }, { 0, 19, 51, 0, 31 },
        { 0, 42, 66, 31, 0 } };

    g.Prim(G, V);
  }
}
```
### AVL Tree Balanced Factor

**Defenition:** Balance factor of an AVL Tree is the height difference between the left and rigth subtree of a vertex in the AVL Tree.Each vertex in an AVL Tree sholud have a balance factor 1,0 or -1.

**AVL Tree:** A Binary tree with each vertex having a balance factor of 1,0 or -1 is an AVL Tree.

In the above diagram since three of the vertices are having balance factor as 2 it is not an AVL Tree.Such Binary trees can be converted to AVL Tree by any of the four rotation methods.

In the above diagram the numbers noted above each vertex is the balance factor of that vertex.Since each vertex is having either balance factor 1,0 or -1 it is an AVL Tree.

# Bubble Sort:

**Definition:** Bubble Sort is the *simplest* sorting algorithm. 
In bubble sort algorithm, *array is traversed from first element 
to last element*. Here, current element is compared with the next 
element. *If current element is greater than the next element, it 
is swapped.*

*Note:* This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average
 and worst-case time complexity is quite high.

**How does it work:**


*Let,s take an array of 5 elements:*


![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Blaize99/C-DAC-Notes/main/Data%20structure/Media/bubble_sort_0 copy.jpg)


* Bubble sort starts with very first two elements, comparing them to check which one is greater.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Blaize99/C-DAC-Notes/main/Data%20structure/Media/bubble_sort_1.jpg)
* In this case, value 33 is greater than 14, so it is already in sorted locations. Next, we compare 33 with 27.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Blaize99/C-DAC-Notes/main/Data%20structure/Media/bubble_sort_2.jpg)
* We find that 27 is smaller than 33 and these two values must be swapped.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Blaize99/C-DAC-Notes/main/Data%20structure/Media/bubble_sort_3.jpg)
* The new array should look like this −

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Blaize99/C-DAC-Notes/main/Data%20structure/Media/bubble_sort_4.jpg)
* Next we compare 33 and 35. We find that both are in already sorted positions.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Blaize99/C-DAC-Notes/main/Data%20structure/Media/bubble_sort_5.jpg)
* Then we move to the next two values, 35 and 10.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Blaize99/C-DAC-Notes/main/Data%20structure/Media/bubble_sort_6.jpg)
* We know then that 10 is smaller 35. Hence they are not sorted.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Blaize99/C-DAC-Notes/main/Data%20structure/Media/bubble_sort_7.jpg)
* We swap these values. We find that we have reached the end of the array. After one iteration, the array should look like this −

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Blaize99/C-DAC-Notes/main/Data%20structure/Media/bubble_sort_8.jpg)
* To be precise, we are now showing how an array should look like after each iteration. After the second iteration, it should look like this −

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Blaize99/C-DAC-Notes/main/Data%20structure/Media/bubble_sort_9.jpg)
* Notice that after each iteration, at least one value moves at the end.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Blaize99/C-DAC-Notes/main/Data%20structure/Media/bubble_sort_10.jpg)
* And when there's no swap required, bubble sorts learns that an array is completely sorted.

 *Below is a GIF example for better understanding*

**Time complexity of Bubble Sort:**

* Bubble sort employs two loops: an inner loop and an outer loop.
* The inner loop performs O(n) comparisons deterministically.

*Worst Case:*
* In the worst-case scenario, the outer loop runs O(n) times.
* As a result, the worst-case time complexity of bubble sort is O(n x n) = O(n x n) (n2).

*Best Case:*
* In the best-case scenario, the array is already sorted, but just in case, bubble sort performs O(n) comparisons.
* As a result, the time complexity of bubble sort in the best-case scenario is O(n).

*Average Case:*
* Bubble sort may require (n/2) passes and O(n) comparisons for each pass in the average case.
* As a result, the average case time complexity of bubble sort is O(n/2 x n) = O(n/2 x n) = O(n/2 x n) = O(n/2 x n) = O (n2).
